 Building Robot which moves on table and reports its direction based on business logic
 
 i have used .Net framework 4.7 to build this console app, while developing i have made few assumptions and designs( which might not be perfect)
 
 - I have used static classes in business model ( Not good , may be should have used SOLID principles interface segregation )
 - Seperated business to different classes , so the classes can be open for modification 
 - close to 10 tests to prove the scenarios works
 - seperating the concerns in code 
 - Using common code in common model 

The tests can be run to see the results also the values can be changed to test other secanrios using test cases.
